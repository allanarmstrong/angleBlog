angleBlog
======

A very basic very buggy very messy front end for a blog written in AngularJS and using Firebase to store the data. Written to get familiar with angularJS and firebase.

To use this simply clone it and put it in a folder anywhere. Don't forget to replace <your firebase url> with your firebase url in controllers.js! You'll need to write your own backend however. 

An example .json file is provided in the js/ folder to show you what the format of the JSON looks like.
